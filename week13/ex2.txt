1. Avoidance: The strategy to avoid creating a deadlock or getting into it. Done by Banker's Algorithm.

2. Prevention: Prevent the deadlock by eleminating any of the four conditions: 
	a. Mutual Exclusion
	b. Hold and Wait
	c. No preemption
	d. Circular wait

3. Recovery: It is done through killing the process and resource preemption.

This can be explained in details by the three basic approaches:
	a.Inform the system operator, and allow him/her to take manual intervention
    	b.Terminate one or more processes involved in the deadlock
	c. Preempt resources
